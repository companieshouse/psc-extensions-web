This is a web frontend for the PSC Extensions journey. It was created based on [Typescript Web Starter for Companies House](https://github.com/companieshouse/node-review-web-starter-ts).

## Terraform ECS

### What does this code do?

The code present in this repository is used to define and deploy a dockerised container in AWS ECS.
This is done by calling a [module](https://github.com/companieshouse/terraform-modules/tree/main/aws/ecs) from terraform-modules. Application specific attributes are injected and the service is then deployed using Terraform via the CICD platform 'Concourse'.


Application specific attributes | Value                                | Description
:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------
**ECS Cluster**        |filing-maintain                                      | ECS cluster (stack) the service belongs to
**Load balancer**      |{env}-chs-chgovuk                                            | The load balancer that sits in front of the service
